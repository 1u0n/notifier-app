# NOTIFIER - APP #

nativescript mobile app to receive notifications from [notifier-web](https://github.com/1u0n/notifier-web) server. Just enter your server parameters (ip, username & password) and it'll keep a connection to receive the notifications generated by the server. If the app gets killed, a background service will run periodically to check with the server for new messages.

Since it uses [Nativescript](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript), this javascript code compiles to native Android and iOS apps.
 
**TODO**

- iOS: Check server while app on background. Nativescript doesn't offer a cross-platform way to do this, only Android part is done so far, so the iOS app isn't quite functional yet.

 
## Use it
grab the [latest release](https://github.com/1u0n/notifier-app/releases/latest) , or: 

- clone/download the repo
- [install](https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup) Nativescript CLI
- connect your mobile phone to the computer or set up an emulator, and:
   ```
   $ tns platform add android
   $ tns run android
   ```
   will automatically download the dependencies, build and launch the app
   

**NOTE**
currently there's a small bug in one of the dependencies, if you are building this yourself, after downloading the dependencies you'll have to make a one-line modification as seen [here](https://github.com/triniwiz/nativescript-sse/issues/5)
